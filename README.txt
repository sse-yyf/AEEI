1. Unfortunately, I had some difficulties to make a folder in Google drive a repository and add it to github desktop. 
    So I created a new folder on my own laptop with the same materials in "Yifan_Yang" folder and made it a repository.
    Then I use robocopy to backup the folder to "Yifan_Yang" on Google drive. I think it solves the problem perfectly.
    (And also a good practice of the backup system.)
